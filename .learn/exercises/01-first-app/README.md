# `01` First App

We are going to start this project by creating our Javascript app. As we are using Learnpack for this assignment, we'll be able to run it very easily and see the results in the terminal.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a file named `app.js` in the root of the repository.

## 💡 Hint:

+ The root of the project is where the file `learn.json` is located.
