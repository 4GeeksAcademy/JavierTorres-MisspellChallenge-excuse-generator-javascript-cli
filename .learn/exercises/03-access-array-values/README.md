# `03` Access Array Values

Now we can print our first excuse in the terminal. The excuses will follow this structure:

![excuse structure](../../assets/excuse-structure.gif)

Basically it has a Who?, a What?, and a When?

We are going to use these arrays to get the value for each of the elements of the excuse:

```js
let who = ['the dog','my grandma','his turtle','my bird']
let what = ['ate my food','pissed in the floor','crushed the phone','broked the glass']
let when = ['before the class','right in time','when I finished','during my lunch','while I was praying']
```

You can copy and paste them in your code. Now if you access to one of the elements of each of the arrays and concatenate them in one string, you'll be able to generate a excuse.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Add the three arrays given (`who`, `what`, and `when`) in your code.

2. Access to the first element of the `who` array and print it in the console.

## üí° Hint:

+ This is the syntax to access an array value: `arrayName[position]` (Remember the position of elements starts in 0, so the position of the first element is 0, the position of the second element is 1, and so on).
