# `04` Concatenate Strings

We were able to access to one of the array values, but that's not it, if we want to generate a excuse, we need to have the full structure, so we should get a value from each of the arrays and add them together in one sentence. 

In programming, this is named concatenate, the action of including many strings (In our case the values we are getting from the arrays), into only one string.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Get the first element from each of the arrays (`who`, `what`, and `when`).

2. Concatenate the elements together in one string, and print it in the console.

## Expected Output:

```
the dog ate my food before the class
```

## üí° Hint:

+ You can concatenate strings by using the `+` or with the backsticks. Here is an article that explains how to concatenate strings: https://4geeks.com/how-to/how-to-concatenate-strings-on-python
