# `06` Generate a random excuse

Now that we know how to get a random value from an array, let's get the random values from each of the arrays (`who`, `what`, and `when`) and concatenate them together to get a random generated excuse.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Generate a random value for each of the arrays (`who`, `what`, and `when`).

2. Concatenate the elements together in one string, and print your random generated excuse in the console.

## Expected Output:

```js
his turtle crushed the phone during my launch
