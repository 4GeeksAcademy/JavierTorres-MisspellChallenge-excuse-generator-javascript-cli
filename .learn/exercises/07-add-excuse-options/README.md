# `07` Add excuse options

And now it's time! We've learned all the necessary skills to generate a random excuse, we generated a random number that can be used to access values from an array, we used this number to get a random value from the array, and concatenate multiple strings together, these are basically the steps to create your own excuse generator.

Here is the structure of an excuse:

Now let's start creating our excuse generator.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Remove all the content from the `app.js` file (Leave it empty).

2. Add the arrays of the excuse structure:

```js
let who = ['The dog','My granma','His turtle','My bird'];
let what = ['ate','pissed','crushed','broked'];
let when = ['before the class','right in time','when I finished','during my lunch','while I was praying'];
```
